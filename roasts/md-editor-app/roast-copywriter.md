# Copywriter Review

**"Build Better AI Prompts, Faster" reads like a committee wrote it after a particularly uninspiring brainstorming session.**

## Analysis

The headline "Build Better AI Prompts, Faster" is rather generic, isn't it? It tells us what the product does, but it doesn't tell us why we should care. The word "better" is particularly weak here—better than what? Better than a blank text editor? Better than competitors? It's a classic case of marketing speak that sounds impressive but says nothing.

The value proposition is buried in the subheadline, which is a shame because "Write prompts for Claude, GPT & Gemini. Track tokens in real-time. Never lose work. All in your browser—completely private, no sign-up required" actually contains the real benefits. This should be the hero message, not relegated to supporting text.

The copy suffers from a lack of differentiation. Privacy is mentioned repeatedly throughout the page, which is good, but it's presented in a rather clinical way. "100% Client-Side Processing" and "Local Storage Only" sound like technical specifications rather than emotional benefits. The privacy angle is strong, but it's not being sold with the passion it deserves.

There's also a rather unfortunate typo in the accessibility snapshot: "Ready to try it your elf?" which suggests either a rendering issue or actual copy problems. Either way, it's not a good look.

The CTAs are consistent, which is good, but "Launch Editor - Free Forever" feels a bit corporate. The dash is unnecessary, and "Free Forever" is a bit of American marketing speak that doesn't quite land. "Start Writing Now" is better, but it's buried lower on the page.

The copy does a reasonable job of explaining features, but it doesn't create desire. It tells us what the product does, but it doesn't make us feel why we need it. The privacy messaging is strong, but it's presented as a list of technical facts rather than a compelling narrative.

## Key Findings

- Headline is generic and lacks differentiation
- Value proposition is buried in subheadline instead of being the hero message
- Privacy benefits are presented too clinically—needs more emotional connection
- Multiple CTAs with slightly different messaging creates confusion
- Copy explains features but doesn't create desire or urgency
- "Free Forever" is rather American marketing speak that doesn't quite work
- Missing a clear narrative arc that takes users from problem to solution
- Feature descriptions read like technical specs rather than user benefits

## Score: 6/10

The copy is clear and functional, but it lacks personality and emotional resonance. The privacy angle is strong but underutilized. The messaging is competent but forgettable, which is rather disappointing for a product with such clear benefits.

## Recommendations

1. Rewrite the headline to focus on the emotional benefit rather than the functional one—something that makes users feel something, not just understand something
2. Elevate the privacy messaging from technical facts to emotional benefits—make users feel safe and in control, not just informed
3. Consolidate CTAs to one primary action with consistent messaging throughout
4. Add urgency or scarcity elements to create desire beyond just listing features
5. Transform feature descriptions from technical specs to user outcomes—focus on what users can do, not what the product is
6. Create a clearer narrative structure that takes users from their current pain point to the solution
7. Remove American marketing speak like "Free Forever" and replace with more authentic British phrasing if targeting that market, or at least more natural language
